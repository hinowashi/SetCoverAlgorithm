# Set Cover Algorithm

This package solves the set cover algorithm using the greedy approach. 

From Wikipedia about the Set Cover Algorithm:

The set cover problem is a classical question in combinatorics, computer science, operations research, and complexity theory. It is one of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems shown to be NP-complete in 1972.
It is a problem "whose study has led to the development of fundamental techniques for the entire field" of approximation algorithms.
Given a set of elements \{1,2,...,n\} (called the universe) and a collection S of m sets whose union equals the universe, the set cover problem is to identify the smallest sub-collection of S whose union equals the universe.
The decision version of set covering is NP-complete, and the optimization/search version of set cover is NP-hard.
If each set is assigned a cost, it becomes a weighted set cover problem.


The development of the algorithm follows the set up in :
